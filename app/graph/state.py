    The state object passed between nodes in the graph.

    Fields:
        messages: Full conversation history including tool calls and results.
                  add_messages is a reducer — it appends new messages rather
                  than replacing the whole list. This is how LangGraph
                  accumulates the agent's reasoning across loop iterations.

        session_id: The session this run belongs to (= LangGraph thread_id).

        collection_name: Which Qdrant collection to search in.

        agent_steps: Human-readable log of tool calls made this run,
                     for the API response (matches your existing AgentStep schema).

        recursion_depth: How deep the current reasoning loop has gone.
